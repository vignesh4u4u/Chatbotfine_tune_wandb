1)  What is the income inclusion rule?

 {'RAG_answer': " Based on the provided context, the income inclusion rule refers to a provision in the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBE Rules) that determines how the income of a multinational enterprise (MNE) is attributed to each of its constituent entities in different jurisdictions. The default assumption is that all of the MNE's Global Income in a jurisdiction is counted towards that jurisdiction for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction's Global Income and Excess Profit. However, there are special circumstances in which the Global Income derived by a Constituent Entity is excluded from the Global Income of that entity due to a special rule.\n\nOne such special rule applies when the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) of the MNE Group is a Flow-Through Entity. In this case, the Global Income of that UPE is reduced by the amount of income attributable to each Ownership Interest that meets certain criteria. There is a corresponding adjustment to the amount of Substance-based Income Exclusion for the jurisdiction. Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets located in the jurisdiction of the UPE are allocated to the UPE and reduced in proportion to the income which is excluded under this provision.\n\nAnother scenario where the income inclusion rule comes into play is when a UPE is subject to a Deductible Dividend Regime and distributes a Deductible Dividend. In this case, the entity reduces (but not below zero) its Global Income by the amount of the dividend if certain criteria are met. The reduction in Global Income under this provision is similar to the reduction that arises under the Flow-Through Entity rule. Stakeholders have sought clarification as to whether there is also a proportionate reduction in Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets where there has been a Deductible Dividend distributed by the UPE which reduces Global Income as a result of Article 7.2.1. The guidance indicates the intention is that there should be a corresponding adjustment to the amounts of Eligible Payroll Cost and Eligible Tangible Assets in such cases.", 'summary': ' The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules include a provision for reducing the Globe Income of a Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) that is a Flow-Through Entity. The income attributed to each Ownership Interest that meets certain criteria is excluded from the UPE\'s Globe Income, resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the Substance-based Income Exclusion for the jurisdiction. Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets located in the jurisdiction of the UPE are allocated to the UPE and reduced in proportion to the income that is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, when a UPE is subject to a Deductible Dividend Regime and distributes a Deductible Dividend, reducing its Globe Income, there should be a corresponding adjustment to the amounts of Eligible Payroll Cost and Eligible Tangible Assets.\n\nThe Inclusive Framework will consider further Administrative Guidance to clarify the meaning of "paid or payable" in the context of this guidance and develop a mechanism of re-computation to minimize the potential for double taxation and double non-taxation under the GloBE Rules.\n\nA Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) is a domestic minimum tax imposed by a jurisdiction on Constituent Entities of an MNE Group that are resident or constitute a permanent establishment in that jurisdiction. The QDMTT operates as a Top-up Tax that is calculated in line with the jurisdictional Effective Tax Rate (ETR) calculation under Chapter 5 of the GloBE Rules. Although some features of the QDMTT may vary from those provided for under the Model Rules, the overall design and outcomes under the QDMTT must be consistent with those provided for under the GloBE rules. The credit mechanism in Article 5.2 ensures that any shortfall in domestic Top-up Tax payable under the QDMTT will simply result in additional tax being payable under the GloBE Rules.'}


2) When will the global minimum tax be effective?
{'RAG_answer': " Based on the provided context, the global minimum tax, as part of the two-pillar solution agreed upon by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in October 2021, is expected to be implemented through the Global anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules. However, the text does not provide specific information about when the global minimum tax will become effective. It mentions that the GloBE Model Rules and Commentary were approved and released in December 2021 and March 2022, respectively. But the timeline for the implementation of these rules varies depending on the jurisdictions adopting them. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an exact date for when the global minimum tax will be effective without additional information.", 'summary': ' The text appears to be about the "Global anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules" agreed upon by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in response to the challenges posed by the digitalization of the economy. These rules aim to ensure that large multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum level of tax on the income earned in each jurisdiction they operate in. The GloBE rules are not mandatory for jurisdictions to adopt, but if they choose to do so, they must implement and administer them consistently with the agreed outcomes.\n\nThe GloBE rules are an interlocking and coordinated system of rules designed to operate together and ensure large MNE Groups are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on any excess profits earned in each jurisdiction. The rules are compatible with the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries and the Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2017.\n\nA Commentary to the GloBE Model Rules was approved and released by the Inclusive Framework on 14 March 2022, along with a set of detailed examples illustrating the application of the rules. The Commentary clarifies the interpretation and operation of the provisions in the GloBE Model Rules and promotes a consistent and common interpretation to provide certainty for MNE Groups and facilitate coordinated outcomes under the rules. However, the Commentary does not provide guidance on every aspect of the GloBE Model Rules, and some issues will require further consideration and development as part of the GLOBE Implementation Framework.\n\nInclusive Framework members have also agreed to apply the GloBE Rules consistent with Agreed Administrative Guidance, subject to any requirements of domestic law. Agreed Administrative Guidance is defined as guidance issued by the Inclusive Framework on the interpretation or administration of the GloBE Rules.'}
