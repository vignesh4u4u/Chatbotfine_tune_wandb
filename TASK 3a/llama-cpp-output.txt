    "result": " me with an example\n\nJava is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform independent. It was first released by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995 and since then it has become one of the most popular programming languages in use today.\n\nHere's a simple example of Java code that prints \"Hello World\" to the console:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a new class named `HelloWorld`. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it is where the code inside the curly braces will be executed when the program runs. Inside the `main` method, we use the `System.out.println` statement to print \"Hello World\" to the console.\n\nTo compile and run this Java program, you can save the code in a file with the name `HelloWorld.java`, then open a terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the following commands:\n\n```bash\njavac HelloWorld.java\njava HelloWorld\n```\n\nThe first command compiles the Java code into machine language that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The second command runs the compiled code. After running this example, you should see \"Hello World\" printed in your console or terminal window."

    "result": "\n\nHere is a simple example of how to add two numbers in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to add two numbers\ndef add_two_numbers(num1, num2):\n    # Add the two numbers and store the result in a variable\n    sum = num1 + num2\n    \n    # Print out the result\n    print(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is:\", sum)\n\n# Call the function with some example values\nadd_two_numbers(3, 5)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `add_two_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers together and stores the result in a variable called `sum`. Finally, the function prints out a message indicating what numbers were added and the resulting sum.\n\nYou can call this function with any two numbers you want by passing them as arguments when you call the function. In the example above, we call the function with the arguments 3 and 5. The function then calculates their sum (8) and prints out a message indicating that it added the numbers 3 and 5 to get a sum of 8."
